18 House is located in a calm dead-end alley in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
The plot is a small rectangle of 18 sqm.
The architects worked with a system of a staircase running along the periphery to take advantage of the space underneath for storage cabinets, toilets, and bathrooms. Furthermore, this staircase placement also opened up to a considerably sizeable vertical space for bunk bed or reading loft.
Despite almost facing a shortage of living space, we still wanted to devote several spots for greeneries to ease off the heavily cramped character of the alley context.
Master bedroom and reading loft are both adorned by a shared plant bed while the rooftop is utilized as a mini veggie garden.
The architectural envelope facing the alley is comprised of a system of slits with various heights which can be operated separately. This means the users can very well control the ventilation level of the house by selecting a specific number of windows to open.
